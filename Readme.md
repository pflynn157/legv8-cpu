## LegV8 CPU

This is my work-in-progress implementation of a LEGv8 CPU in VHDL for school. I'm keeping it here because I'm legit having a ton of fun with it, and I want it for future reference.

The /docs folder contains the stuff I need so I don't have to pull up a bunch of crap when I shift computers. No copyright infringement intended :)

Currently, there is very little automated testing. The best way to make sure it works is to view the CPU.gtkw file, which is a wave form with the entire CPU loaded into it, including about half the register file. You will need GtkWave to view it.
